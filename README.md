Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control are not DIP Implementations

**Inversion of Control** 

  - Is a principle in software engineering by which the control of objects or portions of a program is transferred to a container or framework. It’s most often used in the context of object-oriented programming.

    - Decoupling the execution of a task from its implementation
    - Making it easier to switch between different implementations
    - Greater modularity of a program
    - Greater ease in testing a program by isolating a component or mocking its dependencies and allowing components to communicate through contracts

  - Inversion of Control can be achieved through various mechanisms such as: Strategy design pattern, Service Locator pattern, Factory pattern, and Dependency Injection (DI).
  
**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a pattern through which to implement IoC, where the control being inverted is the setting of object’s dependencies.

**IoC container** is a common characteristic of frameworks that implement IoC.
